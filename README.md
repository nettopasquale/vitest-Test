# VITEST-MINI PROJECT

This is just a mini project, not intended to be viewd in browsers, to test functions
using the VITEST framework;

This project uses:
-Javascript
-Typescript
-Vite enviroment
-ESLint
-Vitest
-date-fns (to create  better functions with dates)

The project is supposed to replicate a simple appointment system, and we
need to make sure it does not let us create an appointment at the same time another one was made,
or create an appointment with a date before today's date. 

So to make sure the tests pass, we made use of Vitest framework, testing possible use cases for the system.
